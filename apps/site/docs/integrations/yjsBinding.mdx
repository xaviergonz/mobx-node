## Overview

`mobx-bonsai` includes a binding with `Y.js` that creates a node that stays in sync with a `Y.js` state in both directions.

For example, if you already have a `Y.js` state representing:

```ts
interface Todo {
  done: boolean
  text: string
}

interface TodoAppState {
  todoList: Todo[]
}
```

and that it is already prepopulated with some todos in a `Y.js` doc map named "todoAppState". All you need to do is:

```ts
const {
  mobxNode: todoAppState,
  dispose
} = bindYjsToNode<TodoAppState>({
  yjsDoc,
  yjsObject: yjsDoc.getMap("todoAppState"),
})
```

and from then on you can read/write the state as if it were a MobX observable, this is:

```ts
// read
const doneTodos = todoAppState.todoList.filter(todo => todo.done)

// write
const toggleTodoDone = action((todo: Todo) => {
  todo.done = !todo.done;
})

toggleTodoDone(todoAppState.todoList[0])
```

and it will be kept in sync with the `Y.js` state.

Note that **the sync is two-way**, so if `Y.js` state gets updated (manually or via a remote state update), the node will get updates as well. All that means that this:

```ts
yjsDoc.transact(() => {
  const newTodo = new Y.Map()
  newTodo.set("done", false)
  newTodo.set("text", "buy milk")
  yjsDoc.getMap("todoAppState").getArray("todoList").push([ newTodo ])
})
```

will also result in a new todo getting added to `todoAppState.todoList` after the transaction is finished.

And of course, since this is a `mobx-bonsai` enhanced MobX observable in the end, you can use reaction, autorun, when, computed, getParent, getSnapshot...

### Working with Initial State

**What if I don't have an intial `Y.js` state yet?**

You can create one like this:

```ts
applyPlainObjectToYMap(
  yjsDoc.getMap("todoAppState"),
  {
    todoList: []
  }
)
```

### Binding Limitations

**`Y.js` binding limits**:

- Changes in the MobX observable are replicated to `Y.js` only after the outermost MobX action has completed. Therefore, avoid executing any `Y.js` transactions until MobX actions finish.
- `Y.js` changes are merged into the MobX observable only after all `Y.js` transactions have concluded. Consequently, do not initiate MobX actions that modify the bound object during an ongoing `Y.js` transaction.


## Utility Functions

### `getYjsObjectForNode`

The `getYjsObjectForNode` function returned by the bind function resolves a `Y.js` structure corresponding to a given node within a bound tree. This is useful when you need to map a node back to its `Y.js` counterpart.

If the target node is not part of the bound tree it throws an error.

```typescript
import * as Y from "yjs"
import { bindYjsToNode } from "mobx-bonsai"

const { node, getYjsObjectForNode } = bindYjsToNode<TodoAppState>({
  ...
});

const firstTodoYjs = getYjsObjectForNode(todoAppState.todoList[0]);
```
