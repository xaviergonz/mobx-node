title: Tree-Like Structure
slug: /tree-like-structure

# Overview

`mobx-bonsai`'s structure is based on a tree-like structure, where each node can be one of:

- An (observable) plain object.
- An (observable) array.
- A primitive value (`string`, `boolean`, `number`, `null`, `undefined`).

Since the structure is a tree, this means these tree rules apply:

1. A non-primitive (object) node can have zero or one parent.
2. A non-primitive (object) node can have zero to infinite children.
3. From rule 1 and 2 we can extract that a same non-primitve node can only be in a single tree and only once.
4. Primitive nodes are always copied by value (as usual in JavaScript), so none of the rules above apply.

# How objects are transformed into nodes

An object/array is turned into a tree node under the following circumstances:

- You call `node` upon them.
- As soon as they become children of another tree node.

Bear in mind that this means that, unless the object being attached to another node is already observable or a node, its reference will change, this is:

```
const todo: Todo = {...};
todoAppState.todoList.push(todo);
// the last item of todoList will be converted to a node and therefore it WON'T be the same as todo
```

This is not really exclusive to this library, but that's how MobX deep observables work really.

To check if a non-primitive has been turned into a tree node you can use `isNode(value: unknown): boolean`.

To turn a non-primitive into a tree node you can use `node` over it. If the object is already a tree node or an observable object then the same object will be returned.

# Traversal methods

When a non-primitive value is turned into a tree node it gains access to certain methods that allow traversing the data tree:

## `getParentPath`

```ts
getParentPath<T extends object>(value: object): ParentPath<T> | undefined
```

Returns the parent of the target plus the path from the parent to the target, or `undefined` if it has no parent.

## `getParent`

```ts
getParent<T extends object>(value: object): T | undefined
```

Returns the parent object of the target object, or `undefined` if there's no parent.

## `getParentToChildPath`

```ts
getParentToChildPath(fromParent: object, toChild: object): Path | undefined
```

Gets the path to get from a parent to a given child.
Returns an empty array if the child is actually the given parent or `undefined` if the child is not a child of the parent.

## `getRootPath`

```ts
getRootPath<T extends object>(value: object): RootPath<T>
```

Returns the root of the target, the path from the root to get to the target and the list of objects from root (included) until target (included).

## `getRoot`

```ts
getRoot<T extends object>(value: object): T
```

Returns the root of the target object, or itself if the target is a root.

## `isRoot`

```ts
isRoot(value: object): boolean
```

Returns `true` if a given object is a root object.

## `isChildOfParent`

```ts
isChildOfParent(child: object, parent: object): boolean
```

Returns `true` if the target is a "child" of the tree of the given "parent" object.

## `isParentOfChild`

```ts
isParentOfChild(parent: object, child: object): boolean
```

Returns `true` if the target is a "parent" that has in its tree the given "child" object.

## `resolvePath`

```ts
resolvePath<T extends object>(pathRootObject: object, path: Path): { resolved: true; value: T } | { resolved: false }
```

Resolves a path from an object, returning an object with `{ resolved: true, value: T }` or `{ resolved: false }`.

## `findParent`

```ts
findParent<T extends object>(child: object, predicate: (parent: object) => boolean, maxDepth = 0): T | undefined
```

Iterates through all the parents (from the nearest until the root) until one of them matches the given predicate.
If the predicate is matched it will return the found node.
If none is found it will return `undefined`.
A max depth of 0 is infinite, but another one can be given.

## `findParentPath`

```ts
findParentPath<T extends object>(child: object, predicate: (parent: object) => boolean, maxDepth = 0): FoundParentPath<T> | undefined
```

Iterates through all the parents (from the nearest until the root) until one of them matches the given predicate.
If the predicate is matched it will return the found node and the path from the parent to the child.
If none is found it will return `undefined`.
A max depth of 0 is infinite, but another one can be given.

## `findChildren`

```ts
findChildren<T extends object>(root: object, predicate: (node: object) => boolean, options?: { deep?: boolean }): ReadonlySet<T>
```

Iterates through all children and collects them in a set if the given predicate matches.

Pass the options object with the `deep` option (defaults to `false`) set to `true` to get the children deeply or `false` to get them shallowly.

## `getChildrenObjects`

```ts
getChildrenObjects(node: object, options?: { deep?: boolean }): ReadonlySet<object>
```

Returns a set with all the children objects (this is, excluding primitives) of an object.

Pass the options object with the `deep` option (defaults to `false`) set to `true` to get the children deeply or `false` to get them shallowly.

## `walkTree`

```ts
walkTree<T = void>(target: object, predicate: (node: object) => T | undefined, mode: WalkTreeMode): T | undefined
```

Walks a tree, running the predicate function for each node.
If the predicate function returns something other than `undefined` then the walk will be stopped and the function will return the returned value.

The mode can be one of:

- `WalkTreeMode.ParentFirst` - The walk will be done parent (roots) first, then children.
- `WalkTreeMode.ChildrenFirst` - The walk will be done children (leaves) first, then parents.

# Utility methods


## `onChildAttachedTo`

```ts
export function onChildAttachedTo<T>(params: {
  target: () => object
  childNodeType: NodeType | readonly NodeType[] | undefined
  onChildAttached: (child: T) => (() => void) | void
  deep?: boolean
  fireForCurrentChildren?: boolean
}): (runDetachDisposers: boolean) => void
```

Runs a callback every time a new object is attached to a given node.
The callback can optionally return a disposer which will be run when the child is detached.

`childNodeType` is a node type indicating the kind of typed children nodes to track, an array to track multiple node types, or `undefined` to track all children.

The optional `options` parameter accepts an object with the following options:

- `deep: boolean` (default: `false`) - `true` if the callback should be run for all children deeply or `false` if it it should only run for shallow children.
- `fireForCurrentChildren: boolean` (default: `true`) - `true` if the callback should be immediately called for currently attached children, `false` if only for future attachments.

Returns a disposer, which has a boolean parameter which should be `true` if pending detachment callbacks should be run, or `false` otherwise.

## `deepEquals`

```ts
deepEquals(a: any, b: any): boolean
```

Deeply compares two values.

Supported values are:

- Primitives
- Boxed observables
- Objects, observable objects
- Arrays, observable arrays
- Typed arrays
- Maps, observable maps
- Sets, observable sets
- Tree nodes (optimized by using snapshot comparison internally)

Note that in the case of models the result will be false if their model IDs are different.
