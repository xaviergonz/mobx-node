This library is very much like `mobx-state-tree`/`mobx-keystone` and takes lots of ideas from them, so the transition
should be fairly simple. There are some trade-offs though, as shown in the following chart:

## Feature Notes

1. Support for self references / cross references / no need for late types, no need for casting,
   etc. It just uses Typescript to define your models.
2. Simplified is an understatement, because these types of cast just don't even exist in `mobx-bonsai`.
3. It is possible to attach an init event using `onNodeInit` (as long as nodes include a `$$type` property) and it is possible to detect when they attach/detach from a tree or a parent using `onChildAttachedTo`.
4. A library like `zod` might be used to do the type validation and infer the Typescript type.
5. A `$$type` property may be included if onInit support is needed, but it is optional.
5. `asMap` and `asSet` wrappers are offered to be able to manipulate objects as if they were maps and arrays as if they were sets.
6. The `Y.js` binding has an undo manager though, so if you use that binding that should be covered.

## TypeScript Improvements

`mobx-state-tree` has some limitations when it comes to TypeScript typings, which are not problems at all with `mobx-bonsai` since it just uses plain Typescript types.

Also, self-recursive or cross-referenced models are impossible (or at least very hard) to properly type in `mobx-state-tree`, but, again, they are no problem with `mobx-bonsai`.

### Simpler Instance / Snapshot Type Usage

Another area of improvement is the simplification of the usage of snapshot vs. instance types. In `mobx-state-tree` it is possible to assign snapshots to properties, as well as actual instances, but the actual type of properties are instances, which leads to confusing casts and constructs such as:

```ts
// mobx-state-tree code

const Todo = types
  .model({
    done: false,
    text: types.string,
  })
  .actions((self) => ({
    setText(text: string) {
      self.text = text
    },
    setDone(done: boolean) {
      self.done = done
    },
  }))

const RootStore = types
  .model({
    selected: types.maybe(Todo),
  })
  .actions((self) => ({
    // note the usage of a union of the snapshot type and the instance type
    setSelected(todo: SnapshotIn<typeof Todo> | Instance<typeof Todo>) {
      // note the usage of cast to indicate that it is ok to use a snapshot when
      // the property actually expects an instance
      self.selected = cast(todo)
    },
  }))
```

In `mobx-bonsai`, since "models" are always just data structures, you just don't have that problem - there's always only one type for all operations, and snapshots are exactly the same type as the node.

### Less Confusion Between this/self Usages

Usually in `mobx-state-tree` code from a previous "chunk" (actions, views) has to be accessed using `self`, while code in the same "chunk" has to be accessed using `this` to get proper typings:

```ts
// mobx-state-tree code

const Todo = types
  .model({
    done: false,
    text: types.string,
    title: types.string,
  })
  .views((self) => ({
    get asStr() {
      // here we use `self` since the properties come from a previous chunk
      return `${self.text} is done? ${self.done}`
    },
    get asStrWithTitle() {
      // here we use `this` for `asStr` since it comes from the current chunk
      return `${self.title} - ${this.asStr}`
    },
  }))
```

In `mobx-bonsai`, since it uses functions for actions/getters/computed/volatiles etc the problem does not apply (no this/self anywhere).

## Simplified Model Life-cycle

`mobx-state-tree` has a couple of life-cycle hooks (`afterCreate`, `afterAttach`, `beforeDetach`, `beforeCreate`) that might or might not trigger when you think they should due to the lazy initialization of nodes.

For example, you might create a submodel with an `afterCreate` hook, but it might never be actually executed unless the node contents are accessed (due to lazy initialization).
Maybe you might want to set up an effect (`reaction` or the like), but you only want that effect to work after it actually becomes part of your application state.
Likewise, you might want to call `getRoot` to access the root model, but it might actually not give the value you expect until the model is attached to a parent which is eventually (or not) attached to the proper root.

`mobx-bonsai` solves this by offering a `onChildAttachedTo` method that you can call for example in your root node to know when a node comes/exits the root store thus ensuring that at that point `getRoot` will return the expected value and makes it a perfect place to set up effects.

For initialization you may either use `onNodeInit` to register what should happen when a node is manually or auto-created (for example useful for migrations) or if you need a initialization/constructor function you may do it in a functional way:

```ts
const createTodo = (todo: Partial<Todo>): Todo {
  return node({ done: false, text: "", ...todo });
}
```
